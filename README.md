# PokemonTCG-remastered
A turn-based strategy game where Pok√©mon have ambiguous abilities, conditional triggers and deceptive move sets, designed so that smart plays can snatch victory from defeat. Players must think not just about what their opponent can do, but what they might be hiding. 

# Game design core Philosophy
This is **not** a reskinned version of the tradtional TCG, it's a diehard fan's dream come true. There are no one-sided beatdowns, unless you've a skill issue. As you fall closer to defeat, more paths to victory open up. Every move and ability have purpose, no more plain old damaging moves with a cool name. 

You'll always find yourself being on the edge of your seat until a victor has been decided, or perhaps tied on a noose, who knows. Just 10-12 Pokemon, yet enough permutations to make the game never feel stale. No advantage comes forth without sacrifice.
